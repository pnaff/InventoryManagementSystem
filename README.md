WGU Software 1 performance assessment

INTRODUCTION
Throughout your career in software design and development, you will be asked to create applications with various features and functionality based on business requirements. For this assessment, you will create a Java desktop application using the solution statements provided in the requirements section of this assessment.

SCENARIO
You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. Members of the organization have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program.

You have been provided with a mock-up of the user interface to use in the design and development of the system and a class diagram to assist you in your work. The organization also has specific business requirements that must be considered for the application. A systems analyst created the solution statements outlined in the requirements section of this task based on the business requirements. You will use these solution statements to develop your application.
